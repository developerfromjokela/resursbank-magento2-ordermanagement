 * to the capture command, and without it, we cannot support partial debit).
 *
 * This class is injected using DI in our observer of the capture process (which
 * does get the invoice supplied) (see Observer/TrackInvoice) and in our capture
 * command class (see Gateway/Command/Capture). This works since Magento by
 * default handles DI as singletons.
 *
 * Effectively this simply lets us access the invoice created during capture in
 * our command class, allowing us to support partial debit while being compliant
 * with the payment gateway specification.
